## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get a development environment up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Baba-Milk-Delivery.git](https://github.com/your-username/Baba-Milk-Delivery.git)
    cd Baba-Milk-Delivery
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, create one in the root of your project and add `flask` to it, then run the command again.*

5.  **Set up environment variables (if any):**
    If your application uses environment variables (e.g., for database connections, API keys), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add them. Example:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///site.db
    SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
    ```

6.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python api/app.py  # Or whatever your main Flask app file is
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or a similar address).
